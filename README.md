# Lab4 CNNs and Keras

This repository contains the lab 4 for the course "Introduction to Machine Vision with Deep Learning."

In this lab, we will be training different Neural Network architectures for object recognition.

To do the lab, go to the file "Lab_4_CNNs.ipynb" in this GitHub repository and click on the "Open in Colab" bar to execute all the code in Google Colab.

If you want to execute this code on your computer instead of in Google Colab. In that case, we recommend installing Anaconda and installing the packages needed for this lab. Take into account that some changes in the code may be required to be compatible with your local machine. Since Colab can limit access to the GPU depending on the resources available, we recommend running it on your device if you have a computer with GPU. If so, please install the TensorFlow-GPU version to be able to benefit from GPU acceleration.


For enabling GPUs for the notebook:
Navigate to Editâ†’Notebook Settings
Select GPU from the Hardware Accelerator drop-down

To submit the answers from the lab, go to "runtime" -> "restart and run all," download the Jupiter notebook by going to File -> download -> download .ipynb and submit the file to Blackboard
